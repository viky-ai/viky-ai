# Welcome to viky.ai

![Some natural language analysis examples](illustration.jpg?raw=true)

## What's viky.ai

viky.ai is a Natural Language Processing platform. It allows you to extract information from unstructured text contents.

The technical component *nlp* allows the extraction of structured information, this extraction is defined within agents. The agents are multilingual assistants to find relevant data. The *nlp* component takes as input a set of agents in JSON format and unstructured textual content in order to provide a JSON stream of structured data as output.

The second technical component [webapp](webapp/README.md) is a web application that allows you to work collaboratively to set up agents by offering dedicated interfaces. It also provides the interpret API in order to allow integration into a third-party system.

## Getting Started

You can run viky.ai on Linux and macOS.

### Requirements

viky.ai local install used for development relies on the following dependencies.

* Docker Engine 19 and Compose 1.24
* Ruby 2.6+ and Bundler 2.0+
* NodeJS 10+ and Yarn 1.19+
* Graphviz 2.40+
* ImageMagick 6.9+
* postgresql-client 11

### Setup and run

1. Clone the repository with submodules using the following command:
   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/viky-ai/viky-ai.git
   ```

2. Setup the application using the following command:
   ```
   $ cd webapp/
   $ ./bin/setup
   ```
   _Take a seat, it may take a while. Setup can take up to 15 minutes and 3GB of disk space._
   (`macOS & Homebrew > $ brew install ruby && brew install postgresql` - issues with missing libraries)

3. Within webapp directory, start the application using the following commands:
   ```
